# Using-Asynchronous-Queues

- A rudimentary web crawler, which recursively follows links on a specified website up to a given depth level and counts the number of visits per link.
- So I vist an online store, go to shoes section, go to a particular shoe brand, particular shoe size and this program deals with how far deep should I go and counts the number of visits per link.
